# DecentIoT Firebase Library

A revolutionary IoT platform that combines a powerful Arduino library with a professional web dashboard. DecentIoT gives you the best of both worlds: **beautiful dashboards like existing platforms** + **complete control with your own Firebase database**.

## 🚀 What Makes DecentIoT Special?

**DecentIoT** is a **complete IoT platform** that combines:
- 🌐 **Professional Web Dashboard** - Create beautiful dashboards with widgets
- 🔧 **Your Own Cloud** - Use your own Firebase Realtime Database
- 📱 **Smart Arduino Library** - This library that connects everything

**No more vendor lock-in!** Use your own Firebase infrastructure while getting a professional dashboard experience.

## Features

- 🎯 **Virtual Pin Architecture** - P0, P1, P2, P3... represent virtual pins that map to your web dashboard widgets
- 🔒 **Your Own Cloud** - Connect to your own Firebase Realtime Database
- 🌐 **Professional Dashboard** - Create beautiful, interactive dashboards with your own backend
- ⚡ **Easy to Use** - Simple macros and intuitive API design
- 🔄 **Real-time Communication** - Bidirectional data flow between device and cloud
- 🛠️ **Production Ready** - Robust, reliable, and well-tested
- 💰 **Cost Effective** - No subscription fees, use your own Firebase infrastructure
- 🔒 **Secure by Default** - Uses Firebase authentication and SSL/TLS for encrypted communication

## How It Works

```
Physical Device          Virtual Pins          Web Dashboard
     ↓                       ↓                      ↓
  D6 (LED)    ←→    P0 (Virtual)    ←→    Button Widget
  A0 (Sensor) ←→    P1 (Virtual)    ←→    Gauge Widget
  A1 (Sensor) ←→    P2 (Virtual)    ←→    Chart Widget
```

1. **Set up your Firebase project** (Google Firebase Console)
2. **Create DecentIoT web dashboard** with widgets
3. **Map widgets to virtual pins** (P0, P1, P2, etc.)
4. **Use this library** to connect your device
5. **Send/receive data** through virtual pins

## Installation

### Arduino Library Manager (Recommended)
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to **Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries**
3. Search for **"DecentIoT Firebase"**
4. Click **Install** (dependencies are automatically installed)

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. In Arduino IDE: **Sketch → Include Library → Add .ZIP Library**
3. Select the downloaded zip file
4. **Manually install dependencies**:
   - `Firebase ESP Client` by Mobizt (version 4.0.0 or higher)
   - `ArduinoJson` by Benoit Blanchon (version 6.0.0 or higher)

## Security Features

🔒 **Firebase Authentication**: Uses Firebase authentication for secure access  
🔒 **SSL/TLS Support**: All communication encrypted with SSL/TLS  
🔒 **Your Own Infrastructure**: Data stays on your Firebase project, not third-party platforms  
🔒 **Production Ready**: Safe for real-world IoT deployments  
🔒 **No Vendor Lock-in**: Complete control over your data and Firebase infrastructure  

For detailed security information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
